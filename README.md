# BNQD
A Python toolbox for Bayesian Nonparametric Quasi-Experimental Design. 

The de facto standard for causal inference is the randomized controlled trial, where one compares a manipulated group with a control group in order to determine the effect of an intervention. However, this research design is not always realistically possible due to pragmatic or ethical concerns. In these situations, quasi-experimental designs may provide a solution, as these allow for causal conclusions at the cost of additional design assumptions. In this repository, we provide a generic framework for quasi-experimental design using Bayesian model comparison. We demonstrate its convenient use in a number of simulations. In addition, we apply the framework to determine the effect of population-based thresholds for municipality funding in France, of the 2005 smoking ban in Sicily on the number of acute coronary events, and of the effect of an alleged historical phantom border in the Netherlands on Dutch voting behaviour.
